Enabling Social Network Conversations in Learning: Procedure
Use the settings in the Social Network Conversations tab on the Manage Setup page to enable social network conversations in learning items. When you enable social network conversations, 
learners view the Social tile and content area in course, specialization, or offering. <br>They can join, share, and collaborate on the learning item with their peers, other learners, or instructors.
You can restrict the social network conversation to enrolled learners only or open it for not enrolled learners too. This topic details 
the steps to enable global options so that enrolled learners can view and collaborate on all specialist-created content.<br>
<br>Learning is available for everyone, anytime, anywhere. Learners can discover, consume, publish, and collaborate using the social features of liking, recommending, or contributing to the conversation.
 They can also download content to mobile devices to consume learning offline.
Oracle Learning Cloud is an Enterprise Learning Management System. We have re-imagined learning for how learners want to learn, how managers want to manage their team's learning, 
and how administrators want to deploy and track compliance and development-based learning.<br>
Learners can discover and consume learning that is relevant to their job roles. Subject matter experts can easily share their knowledge with the rest of the organization and gain recognition for their contributions. 
Managers can push learning to their teams and track the teams progress.
HR specialists can manage the learning catalog and drive compliance needs by administering required learning across the entire organization. 
Learning specialists can assemble online offerings, courses, and specializations using videos and SCORM-compliant content.
